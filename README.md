# Node Js Mastery

# Node.js Overview

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It's widely used for building scalable network applications.

## Key Features of Node.js
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Non-blocking I/O model handles multiple requests concurrently.
- **Single-Threaded Model**: Uses a single thread to handle all requests, relying on events and callbacks for performance.
- **Built-in Libraries**: Comes with modules like `http`, `fs`, `path`, `events`, etc., reducing the need for external dependencies.
- **High Performance**: Powered by Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine for fast execution.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Offers a large ecosystem of open-source libraries.

## Use Cases of Node.js
- **Web Applications**: Back-end services using frameworks like Express.js.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Chat apps, live streaming, or collaborative tools.
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs for integration with front-end applications.
- **Task Automation**: Scripts for automating workflows.
